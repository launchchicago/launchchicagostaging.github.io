The best way to learn to be a software developer is with in-person training and working with other students in a team environment. Although many may believe that software development is a lonely task between the developer and the computer, in this day and age, that could not be farther from the truth. Most development is done in a team environment where different members take on differet components to create a final product. That being said, we understand that this is not a "coding bootcamp" where students can commit to a full-time program.  Because of this, we have attempted to provide the best of both worlds through a combination of asynchronous content followed with in-person, in-class sessions.

# Program Delivery

## Cohort Focused
The Launch content is meant to be taken by a group of students together. This is the best way for students to build a social/professional network of other students going through the same program, ask questions and most importantly support each other.  Cohorts launch several times a year with plenty of overlap of different courses so your wait for the next cohort start is never more than a couple of months.

## Asynchronous
Students will use the Launch Platform software to engage with their launch checklist and know which content they should cover first. This platform will provide the video and textual content, access to code snippets, labs and quizzes. Once completed, new content is unlocked.

## Saturday Launch Pad In-Person 
Each weekend during the cohort the entire class will meet, in-person at their designated [Launch Pad](./location) from 9am - Noon. During this time students have the opportunity to work with each other on team assignments, pair programming, ask and answer each others questions, perform code reviews with the rest of the class and gain insights from guest speakers.
