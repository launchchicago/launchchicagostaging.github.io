The best way to learn to be a software developer is with in-person training and working with other students in a team environment. However, we understand that as a high school or junior college student, there is little to no time to take another program during the day.

This is why we have developed the `Launch Program`. This program consists of 3 primary components.

1. The **Launch Platform App** that runs on an iPad and natively on a Mac which is the primary delivery resource for all the content and tracking of student progress throughout your Launch sequence.

2. **Asynchronous** content including videos, labs, quizzes and other excercises.

3. **Launch Pad** meet-ups each weekend for in-person training, guest speakers, pair programming, working with your mentor, etc.

# Program Delivery

## Cohort Focused
The Launch content is meant to be taken by a group of students together. This is the best way for students to build a social/professional network of other students going through the same program, ask questions and most importantly support each other.  Cohorts launch several times a year with plenty of overlap of different courses so your wait for the next cohort start is never more than a couple of months.

## Asynchronous
Students will use the Launch Platform software to engage with their launch checklist and know which content they should cover first. This platform will provide the video and textual content, access to code snippets, labs and quizzes. Once completed, new content is unlocked.

## Saturday Launch Pad In-Person 
Each weekend during the cohort the entire class will meet, in-person at their designated [Launch Pad](./location) from 9am - Noon. During this time students have the opportunity to work with each other on team assignments, pair programming, ask and answer each others questions, perform code reviews with the rest of the class and gain insights from guest speakers.
