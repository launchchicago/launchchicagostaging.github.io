The best way to learn to be a software developer is with in-person training and working with other students in a team environment. Although many may believe that software development is a lonely task between the developer and the computer, in this day and age, that could not be farther from the truth. Most development is done in a team environment where different members take on differet components to create a final product.

# Course Delivery
## In-Person
The majority of our program is delivered in our beautiful tech innovation space. Classes not only include direct instruction from practicing professionals in the field, but also supported by TA's. In addition there is ample breakout space for team collaboration and development
## Asynchronous (On-line)
Some courseware can be done completely on-line. For example, to earn badges associated with algorithm or data structure challenges, these can be completed solely on-line. Our goal, however, is to keep the on-line component to only those aspects of the program that lend themselves to that delivery medium
## Hybrid
Our program does not support a total hybrid model where some students only attend remotely and others are in-person. The hybrid approach that we do support, is that all classes are recorded and livestreamed, however, this is meant to provide content for those students that have had an unforseen situation that prevents them from attending class in-person.
