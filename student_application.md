# You only need 3 things to apply
1. You must live in a [Chicago Opportunity Zone](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/dcd/supp_info/opportunity-zones.html), or you are a member of an underpresented group in the STEM field.
2. A `Letter of Recommendation` from a teacher at your high-school or community college. Send your teacher [to this link](../teacher_recommendation/index.html) so that they know what we are looking for in their letter.
3. We want to hear from you. Why do you want to be part of this program? You can write this like an essay on simple paper and pencil, email, or do it as a mobile phone video (if you have access).  The medium of submission is not relevant. The content of your answer is.

Deadlines for submission to be accepted into a cohort are shown below in the following table.
