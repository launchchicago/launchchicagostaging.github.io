## Facts
---
1. In 2024, experts expect there will be a surplus of one million open computer science jobs without trained workers to fill them.

2. Computer Science is the #1 ticket to the middle class and is one of the highest paying jobs with an undergraduate degree.

3. Full 4-year degree costs continue to grow, some now exceeding 200K over 4 years. However, many software development jobs do not require a degree and mobile development is one of them.

4. Many qualified individuals never enter the computer science field because of lack of exposure, educational resources, equipment, ill-equipped schools, etc.

## Our Vision
---
We believe that talent is ubiquitous. Working with our staff, partners, and volunteers we have created a broad curriculum that will provide a huge lift for individuals so that they may become junior mobile developers, either working independently or on a small start-up team when completing the program.

Students will have the opportunity to learn and grow as fast as their **aptitude and commitment** will take them. Additionally, students can earn several levels of certification and specialization, and gain access to internships from many companies here in the Chicagoland area.

Students build their own portfolios over the course of the program and work to achieve a Launch certification which we hope will become industry-recognized for excellence.

Our primary instruction is a combination of asynchronous and in-person programming, at our amazing  [Chicago Launch Pad.](./location)

## How do we measure success?
---
It's pretty simple. It is the number of students employed after graduation, in their field of study through the Launch program.
