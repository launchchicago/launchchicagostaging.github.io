## The Challenge
---
1. Computer Science as a field and profession continues to grow at a staggering rate. Over a million new computer science jobs will be created in the next decade significantly exceeding the number of computer science graduates entering the field.
2. Computer Science is the #1 ticket to the middle class and is one of the highest paying jobs with an undergraduate degree.
3. Full 4-year degree costs continues to grow, now averaging 200K over 4 years, however, many software development jobs do not require a degree.
4. Many qualified individuals never enter the computer science field because of lack of exposure, educational resources, equipment, poor schools, etc.

## Our Vision
---
Launch is a classic vocational program which has been created specifically to address these challenges. Working with our full-time staff, partners and volunteers we have created a broad curriculum that will provide a huge lift for individuals so that they may become junior developers, either working independently or on small a small start-up team when completing the program.  The result is being able to earn a full-time salary north of $50K while not incurring a large college debt.

Students will have the opportunity to grow in a broad curriculum as fast as their **aptitude and commitment** will take them. Additionally, students can earn several levels of certification and specialization and gain access to internships from many companies here in the Chicagoland area.

Students build their own portfolios over the course of the program and work to achieve a Launch certification which we hope will become industry recognized for excellence.

Our primary instruction is done live, in-person, at our amazing incubator space in Chicago.
