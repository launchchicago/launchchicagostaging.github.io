title: Program Pathways
---

When going through our program you can start without any understand of a formal programming language, and by the end, the student will have developed, submitted, and had an iOS app accepted into the App Store. Note our initial program is very iOS focused because that is where our Executive Directors skillset lies.  However, once we solidify this program, our intent is to offer similar programs for Android, Cloud, etc.

### What you will earn
---

1. A Launch **iOS Apprentice Certification**
2. **Badges** associated with extra programming challenges in Algorithms and Data Structures
3. Optional **Endorsements** in key focus areas within iOS

Of course, the goal of the program is NOT to just earn these recognitions. They are a means to an end. These achievements, combined with Launch's work with employers in our community to understand what is involved in achieving these recognitions, give the student a higher probability of employment at the completion of the program.

The diagram above shows the progression a student goes through to achieve an iOS Apprentice Certification from Launch.

1. Students, when starting the program should have some basic knowledge of block programming. If they don't the student will need to complete
   1. `Learn to Code 1` and
   2. `Learn to Code 2`from Apple Playgrounds, or equivalent.
   This is done asynchronously by the student before starting the program.

2. The main pathway goes from
   1.  `Programming Fundamentals in Swift I` to
   2.  `App Dev with SwiftUI` to
   3.  `Programming Fundamentals in Swift II`
   4.  `Advanced App Dev with Swift` resulting in submital and acceptance of an app into the Apple App Store.

3. Along this journey students are expetected to also complete the following activities.
   1. Building their portfolio in Github for prospective employers to view
   2. Participated in at least 1 internship with a company and have received letters of recommendation from each
   3. Made some contribution to an open source project
   4. Earned one badge in both `Algorithms 1` and `Data Structures 1`
   
4. Additionally students have the option, but it is not required, to earn special endorsements in areas of concentration such as
   1. Augmented Reality with ARKit
   2. Machine Learning with Core ML
   3. Game Development with SpriteKit or SceneKit
