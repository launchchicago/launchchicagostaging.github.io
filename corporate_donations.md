As a Corporation you have several ways to donate.
1. A simple cash gift which helps fund our programs. You will be listed as a Corporate Sponsor
2. A cash donation aligned with a student stipend.
3. Equipment donation. We can always use good equipment.

### Advantages for your Company / Corporation
1. You are giving back to your community and helping launch a young adult into a good paying profession that they would not normally have available to them
2. You will be first in line (along with other corporate donors) for access to students that are rising to the top of their cohort for internships and access to employment after their successful completion of the program
