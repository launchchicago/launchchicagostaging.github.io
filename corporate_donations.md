### What does your donation fund?

## Equipment
   
   1. Each student needs a Mac laptop to go through the program. Most, if not all, do not currently own a computer of any kind, or not a Mac. These laptops are loaned to students, and can be given to them after a successful launch from the program or returned if they exit the program early.

   2. Many students may not have access to internet in their homes.  In this scenario we loan them a cellular hotspot so that they have access throughout the program. These are returned once they leave or complete the program.

## Student Stipend

  Some students are in situations where they need to work outside of school hours to provide income for their families. In this case we offer a stipend to the student to offset the family concern that income would be lost by their participation in Launch. Stipends are cohort based and vary depending on length of the cohort.

* Non-profit overhead costs primarily associated with professional fees such as accounting, webhosting, etc.

* Note all activities provided by instructors and mentors are on a volunteer basis.

### Advantages for your Company / Corporation
1. You are giving back to your community and helping launch a young adult into a good paying profession that they would not normally have available to them
2. You will be first in line (along with other corporate donors) for access to students that are rising to the top of their cohort for internships and access to employment after their successful completion of the program
