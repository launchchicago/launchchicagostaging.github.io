What does your donation fund?

* Equipment. 
   
   1. Each student needs a Mac laptop to go through the program. Most, if not all, do not currently own a computer of any kind, or not a Mac. These laptops are loaned to students, and can be given to them after a successful launch from the program
   2. Many students do not have easy access to internet in their homes or at local coffee shops etc.  In this scenario we loan them a cellular hotspot so that they have access throughout the program. These are returned once they leave or complete the program.

* Student Stipend
  Some students come from families where they need to work outside of school hours to provide income for their families. In this case we offer a stipend to the student to offset the family concern that income would be lost by their participation in Launch. Stipends are cohort based and vary depending on length of the cohort.

* Non-profit overhead costs primarily associated with professional fees such as accounting, webhosting, etc.
