It is our belief that there are many young adults in underserved communities that would excel in a software development career, such as mobile development. Their only roadblock is that they were born into a family and community that does not have the availability or resources for them to reach their true potential.

Many of these communities have public schools that are not equipped, either based on teacher training or equipment to teach even the most basic aspects of Computer Science. Additionally, we have lost the concept of vocational education; everything today is focused on college prep. We believe this leaves many young adults without the exposure to opportunities that do not require a 4-year degree.

When our Executive Director was in high school, here in Chicago, he was able to test into attending Lane Tech. At that time, Lane Tech High School was not just a **college prep** school but also had a **strong vocational track**. There were classes in linotype printing, drafting, machining, welding, woodworking, electrical, and automotive. Here students were able to get a flavor of many aspects of vocations they might want to pursue after graduation. Students were free to choose the track they wanted to pursue.

Launch is all about removing the barriers, as best we can, so that students from these underserved communities not only have the opportunity to be exposed to software development but can participate in a program that will give them the skills to work in the field once completed.

* Don't own a computer, no problem, **we will loan you one**.
* No internet access at home, no problem, **we will loan you a cellular hotspot** so you can get access.
* No money for the CTA, no problem, **we will cover your transportation costs**.
* Need to work to provide for your family, no problem, **we will provide you a stipend to offset the lost wages**.

In the end, an individual's success in our program should be solely gaited on the students' **aptitude and ambition**, not on the neighborhood they live, or their economic situation.
