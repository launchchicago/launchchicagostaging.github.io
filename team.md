**Kevin McQuown, Founder, Executive Director**

I consider myself an effective leader with an acute attention to detail. With a degree in Computer Science combined with a strong Digital Electronics background, I love spending my days architecting and building systems. One minute I'm drawing out schematics or laying out PCB's, the next I'm writing iOS code to interface with the firmware I wrote for the micro-controller on the board I just designed.

**John Lynch, Curriculum Developer, Instructor**

I am a Curriculum Designer and Swift Instructional Educator for the Center for Excellence in Computer Science, an iOS development contractor, an Adjunct Instructor at DePaul University and Computer Systems Institute in Computer Science, and the Principal Investigator for a HCI research group at DePaul University led by Dr. Craig Miller. My research interests are in collaborative technology in the classroom to support Computer Science learning, the development and implementation of notional machines, and ways to reduce the Imposter Phenomena in novice Computer Science students. My goal is to increase the retention rate for studying Computer Science at all education levels, reduce the exclusivity and barriers present to practicing Computer Science, and make the field more accessible to all populations.
