**Kevin McQuown, Founder, Executive Director**

I have a BS in Computer Science with a strong digital electornics focus.  I worked on avionics software for the F-16 out of college and I have been an iOS developer for as long as you could make iOS apps. I teach iOS development for Northwestern's CECSE program along with building of App Dev with Swift Curriculum.

**John Lynch, Curriculum Developer, Instructor**

I am a Curriculum Designer and Swift Instructional Educator for the Center for Excellence in Computer Science, an iOS development contractor, an Adjunct Instructor at DePaul University and Computer Systems Institute in Computer Science, and the Principal Investigator for a HCI research group at DePaul University led by Dr. Craig Miller. My goal is to increase the retention rate for studying Computer Science at all education levels, reduce the exclusivity and barriers present to practicing Computer Science, and make the field more accessible to all populations.

I have a background in entrepreneurship and I believe it shows in my day-to-day work. I am a strong communicator, I like to network, learn my colleagues' strengths, and build strong, collaborative teams. I am always looking for opportunities for improvement and innovation.
