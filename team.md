I am a Curriculum Designer and Swift Instructional Educator for the Center for Excellence in Computer Science,  an iOS development contractor, an Adjunct Instructor at DePaul University and Computer Systems Institute in Computer Science, and the Principal Investigator for a HCI research group at DePaul University led by Dr. Craig Miller. My research interests are in collaborative technology in the classroom to support Computer Science learning, the development and implementation of notional machines, and ways to reduce the Imposter Phenomena in novice Computer Science students. My goal is to increase the retention rate for studying Computer Science at all education levels, reduce the exclusivity and barriers present to practicing Computer Science, and make the field more accessible to all populations. |
